description: Run Google Core Web Vitals and PageSpeed audits against URLs. Use when asked to check site performance, CWV scores, LCP/CLS/INP/FCP/TTFB metrics, PageSpeed Insights, compare two sites, compare Shopify preview themes vs production, or bulk-audit URLs from a Google Sheet. Supports single URL, compare (two URLs side-by-side including Shopify theme QA), batch (multiple URLs), local measurement (Puppeteer, no API needed), and Google Sheet modes with CrUX field data preferred, lab fallback, and browser scraping for errors.

# Core Web Vitals Skill

Audit website performance using Google's CrUX field data (real user metrics) and PageSpeed Insights API.

## Prerequisites

- `GOOGLE_PAGESPEED_API_TOKEN` env var (Google PageSpeed Insights API key)
- `gog` CLI for Google Sheets operations (alternative to service account auth)
- `agent-browser` CLI for web.dev scraping fallback

## Environment Setup

The scripts auto-load `.env` files from the working directory or skill root. No manual export needed.

If `GOOGLE_PAGESPEED_API_TOKEN` is in a `.env` file, the scripts will find it automatically. Users can also pass `--api-key` inline.

**⚠️ NEVER echo, print, or display the API key value.**

## Five Modes

### 1. Single URL
User provides one URL. Run the API, return formatted results inline.

### 2. Compare (two URLs)
User provides two URLs to compare. Run both, show side-by-side with winner highlighted per metric.

### 3. Batch (multiple URLs)
User provides URLs separated by line breaks. Run each, return formatted table.

### 4. Local Measurement (--local flag)
Measure CWV locally using Puppeteer + web-vitals library. No API key needed. Supports desktop and mobile (with throttling). Use for batch measurements without API quota limits, testing auth-protected sites, or measuring Shopify preview URLs.

### 5. Google Sheet
User provides a Sheet URL. Read URLs from column A, write results to columns B-N with conditional formatting.

## Data Source Priority

1. **CrUX Field Data** (preferred) — Real user metrics from Chrome UX Report (28-day p75 values). This matches what web.dev shows prominently.
2. **Lab Data** (fallback) — Lighthouse synthetic test. Used when CrUX has insufficient traffic data.
3. **Browser Scraping** (error retry) — Load web.dev in agent-browser, wait for results, parse the page. Used when API times out.

**Important:** CrUX field data ≠ Lighthouse lab data. Field data reflects real users; lab data simulates a throttled mobile device. Always prefer field data — it's what Google uses for ranking signals.

## Metrics Collected

| Metric | Field (CrUX) | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|-------------|------|-------------------|------|
| LCP (s) | ✅ p75 | ≤ 2.5 | 2.5–4.0 | > 4.0 |
| CLS | ✅ p75 | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1–0.25 | > 0.25 |
| INP (ms) | ✅ p75 | ≤ 200 | 200–500 | > 500 |
| FCP (s) | ✅ p75 | ≤ 1.8 | 1.8–3.0 | > 3.0 |
| TTFB (s) | ✅ p75 | ≤ 0.8 | 0.8–1.8 | > 1.8 |

CWV Assessment: FAST / AVERAGE / SLOW (from CrUX overall_category)

## Modes 1-4: Single, Compare, Batch, and Local

All handled by `scripts/pagespeed-single.py`. The script auto-detects the mode based on URL count:

```bash
# Single URL (Google API)
python3 scripts/pagespeed-single.py example.com

# Compare two URLs (Google API)
python3 scripts/pagespeed-single.py site-a.com site-b.com

# Batch (3+ URLs, Google API)
python3 scripts/pagespeed-single.py site1.com site2.com site3.com

# Local measurement (Puppeteer, no API)
python3 scripts/pagespeed-single.py --local example.com

# Local with mobile emulation
python3 scripts/pagespeed-single.py --local --mobile example.com

# Local compare mode
python3 scripts/pagespeed-single.py --local site-a.com site-b.com

# With inline API key
python3 scripts/pagespeed-single.py --api-key YOUR_KEY example.com
```

### Local Mode (--local flag)

When `--local` is passed, the script shells out to `scripts/pagespeed-local.js` which uses Puppeteer + web-vitals library to measure CWV locally.

**Prerequisites:**
- `npm install puppeteer web-vitals` in the skill directory

**What it does:**
1. Launches headless Chromium via Puppeteer
2. Injects web-vitals IIFE library via `evaluateOnNewDocument` before page load
3. Collects CWV metrics (LCP, FCP, CLS, TTFB, INP) into `window.__performanceMetrics`
4. Calculates TBT (Total Blocking Time) from long tasks (using PerformanceObserver)
5. Waits for metrics to stabilize (5-10s after load)
6. Forces LCP finalization by clicking body and simulating interactions
7. Returns metrics in same format as API mode

**Mobile mode (--mobile flag):**
- Viewport: 412x823 (Pixel 4)
- Network throttling: 3G (1.5 Mbps down, 750 Kbps up, 40ms latency)
- CPU throttling: 4x slowdown
- Mobile user agent

**Output:**
Data source labeled as "Local (Puppeteer)" vs "CrUX Field Data" or "Lighthouse Lab"

**When to use:**
- No PageSpeed API key available
- Measuring sites behind auth/firewall
- Batch measurements without API quota limits
- Testing Shopify preview URLs (production theme vs dev theme in preview mode)

**Limitations:**
- INP often returns N/A (requires real user interactions across the page lifecycle)
- Results may vary slightly between runs
- Mobile throttling is simulated, not real device performance
- TBT, TTI, Speed Index are approximations (not available from web-vitals library)

### Shopify Theme QA Detection

When comparing two URLs, detect if they share the same domain with `?preview_theme_id=` parameters. If so, this is a **Shopify theme QA comparison** (not a competitor comparison). Adjust the output framing:

- **Competitor compare** (different domains): "Who's faster?" — neutral winner per metric
- **Theme QA** (same domain, both have preview_theme_id): "Did we regress?" — first URL is "Before" (production theme in preview mode), second is "After" (development theme in preview mode). Both must be preview URLs for apples-to-apples comparison since Shopify preview mode adds inherent overhead vs the live site.

For theme QA, use this framing:
- Label URLs as **"Before"** (theme ID from first URL) and **"After"** (theme ID from second URL)
- Show the delta for each metric (e.g., "+0.7s", "-5ms")
- Flag regressions with ⚠️ ("LCP regressed 0.7s")
- Flag improvements with 🎉 ("INP improved 5ms")
- Summary: "X regressions, Y improvements, Z unchanged"
- If ANY CWV metric crosses a threshold boundary (green→yellow, yellow→red), add a strong warning: "🚨 Do not publish — CWV regression detected"

### Running Scripts

The script auto-loads `.env` from the working directory (searching upward). **Run from the project root in a single Bash call:**

```bash
cd /path/to/project && python3 /path/to/skills/core-web-vitals/scripts/pagespeed-single.py example.com
```

Or if the user's `.env` is elsewhere, source it first in the same command:

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' /path/to/.env | xargs) && python3 scripts/pagespeed-single.py example.com
```

Do NOT:
- Check for env vars in a separate Bash call (each call is a new shell)
- Write your own curl commands or inline Python
- Echo or verify the API key value

## Mode 3: Google Sheet

Use `scripts/pagespeed-bulk.py` in this skill directory.

### Prerequisites
- `GOOGLE_PAGESPEED_API_TOKEN` env var (or pass `--api-key`)
- Google Sheets auth: either a service account JSON key (`--credentials`) or `gog` CLI (`--account`)
- The Google Sheet must be editable by the auth identity (share with service account email or gog account)
- Column A must contain URLs (starting at A2, A1 is header)

### Setup
1. Extract spreadsheet ID from the Google Sheet URL (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`)
2. Set headers B1:N1 via Sheets API or manually:
   - B1: M-LCP (s), C1: M-CLS, D1: M-INP (ms), E1: M-FCP (s), F1: M-TTFB (s), G1: M-CWV
   - H1: D-LCP (s), I1: D-CLS, J1: D-INP (ms), K1: D-FCP (s), L1: D-TTFB (s), M1: D-CWV
   - N1: Data Source

### Run
```bash
# With service account
python3 -u scripts/pagespeed-bulk.py SPREADSHEET_ID --credentials service-account.json

# With gog CLI
python3 -u scripts/pagespeed-bulk.py SPREADSHEET_ID --account EMAIL

# Resume from index N, custom workers
python3 -u scripts/pagespeed-bulk.py SPREADSHEET_ID --credentials sa.json --start N --workers 6
```

### Monitor
```bash
tail -f /tmp/pagespeed.log
```

### Retry Errors (browser scraping)
After main run completes, retry ERROR rows via web.dev:
```bash
python3 -u scripts/pagespeed-retry-browser.py SPREADSHEET_ID --credentials sa.json
```

### Conditional Formatting
Apply via Google Sheets batchUpdate API (see references/conditional-formatting.md). Colors:
- Green: good threshold
- Yellow: needs improvement
- Red: poor threshold

Applied to all metric columns for all data rows.

## Key Learnings

- **gog CLI quirk:** Multiple positional values get concatenated into one cell. Always write ONE cell per update call, or use the Sheets API directly for batch row writes.
- **API timeouts:** Heavy Shopify sites often timeout (60-90s). Use browser scraping fallback.
- **CrUX vs Lab confusion:** Users expect web.dev numbers. Web.dev defaults to showing CrUX field data prominently. Always use CrUX when available.
- **Rate limits:** 25K requests/day, 400/100s with API key. Parallel workers (4) stay well under limits.
- **CLS values from CrUX:** Returned as percentile × 100 (e.g., 26 = 0.26). Divide by 100.
- **Batch Sheets API writes:** Use PUT to `spreadsheets/{id}/values/{range}?valueInputOption=RAW` for whole-row writes (much faster than per-cell gog CLI calls).
- **Read full sheet range:** Always check actual row count. Don't assume 200 rows.
